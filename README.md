### Overview

Your goal is to build a membership-tracking application in Ruby on Rails - for public libraries. Your app will allow users to sign up and track their memberships in various libraries. 

### Goals

By the end of this lab you will have:

* Basic-Auth: sign up, log in, log out
* Basic views for your users
* A Many-to-Many database relationship: Users, Libraries, Library Users
* "Skinny" controllers

### Getting Started

Do not fork and clone this repo, as you will be creating a new Rails project. You should, however, track your project in git and GitHub.  Make frequent commits with descriptive commit messages!
